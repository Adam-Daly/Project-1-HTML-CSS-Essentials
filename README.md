# Dream Machines

Dream Machines is a website to introduce and inform those interested in game development about why they should use a game engine and which ones might be appropriate for them.

The goal of the website is to educate those who might find it difficult to know where to start with game development and offer a solution through breaking down which engines do what, what games have been made with the game engines, their strengths and weaknesses and providing a practical starting point with an embedded youtube tutorial from a quality source.

A newsletter and social media links will provide furtger engagement and direction for anyone who needs more information or has questions.

## Testing 

I have tested the website using chromes developer tools to emulate different screen sizes and environments. This helped me to get feedback on how my website displayed at various screen sizes and use media queries and responsive CSS to ensure a consistent standard of user experience across desktop, phone and tablets.
