                    <h3>What are the main features of Unreal Engine?</h3>
                    <p>Due to its robust graphical capabilities with lighting, shaders, and more, Unreal Engine is the power-house behind many of the most popular, triple-A games out there today.  Given its rampant use in that sector, the engine has been developed very specifically to handle a lot of complicated tasks more efficiently than other engines.  The engine is also open-source, meaning the community is constantly improving the engine as well.</p>

                    <p>Along with its visual blueprinting so even non-programmers can develop their games, Unreal truly is a power-house that is capable of just about anything â€“ including VR.  Did we also mention that, like Unity, there is also a Marketplace where you can get free assets?</p>

                    <p>However, many game developers do report that Unreal Engine is better suited for larger projects and projects you intend to work on as a team.  Additionally, as the program is heavy on the graphics end, many people will find it requires a more powerful computer compared to other engines like Unity.  Beyond this, it is also noteworthy that while Unreal Engine can create 2D games in addition to 3D games, the engine is not necessarily the best suited for the task.</p>
