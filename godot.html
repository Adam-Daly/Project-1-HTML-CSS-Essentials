                    <h3>What are the main features of Godot?</h3>
                    <p>Even though Godot has been around since 2014, it’s only recently that the engine has truly picked up in popularity.  The Godot game engine is fantastic if you’re looking for something free and open-source, meaning you can alter the engine and sell your games however you would like.  The engine supports both 2D and 3D capabilities, so it is well-rounded for any sort of game you’re trying to make.</p>

                    <p>Godot also takes a unique approach with its node and scene architecture to represent specific game functions, setting it apart from similar competitors and which may be easier for many users.  Add a passionate community surrounding the engine, and you’ve got a real winner on your hands!</p>

                    <p>As for weaknesses, Godot does use its own personal language for scripting, called GDScript.  While the language works fantastically and is reminiscent of Python (a favorite language for many developers), as it was specifically designed for Godot, experienced game developers may consider it tedious to adapt to yet another language.  Additionally, as Godot is not as well known as some other engines here, there aren’t as many resources available compared to a staple engine like Unity or Unreal.</p>
