                    <h3>Why do I need a Game Engine?</h3>
                    <p>Game engines are software development tools designed to reduce the cost, complexity, and time-to-market required in the development of video games. These software tools create a layer of abstraction on top of the most common tasks in developing video games. The layers of abstraction are packaged together into tools designed to function as interoperable components which can be replaced outright or extended with additional 3rd party components.</p>
                    <p>Game engines provide tremendous efficiency benefits by reducing the depth of knowledge required to make games. They can be minimal in their pre-built functionality or full-featured, allowing game developers to focus entirely on writing gameplay code. Game engines offer an incredible advantage over starting from scratch for solo developers or teams who just want to focus on making the best game possible.</p>

                    <p>There are many different types of game engines, and there are no rules as to what functionality is absolutely required to be considered a game engine. The most popular game engines contain some or all of the following functionality:</p>
